# Arc Tests

## TODO

Ideally, these tests should be able to be run in Arc 3.2 to
demonstrate that they follow Arc’s specification.  We’d need a
mechanism to selectively run tests for features that deliberately
extend or modify Arc.

### Tests wanted

* keep
* trues
* pull
* togglemem
* zap
* iflet
* whenlet
